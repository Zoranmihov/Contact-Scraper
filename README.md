# Contact-Scraper

A basic web scraper which attempts to scrape emails and phone numbers from provided domains. Note: This project uses chrome, you might need to edit the executablePath variable in the getHTML function inside fetchingFunctions.js in the utils directory, or remove it all together to use the inbuilt chromium that comes with puppeteer.
